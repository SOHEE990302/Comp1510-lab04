 * 
 *     Answer.
 *     1. Do you need getters and setters for max? Should you have them?
 *     No, you do not need getters and setters for max because max is final,
 *     so its value cannot be changed.
 *     2. Can you have getters and setters for max?
 *     No, you cannot have getters and setters for max because max is final.
 *     3. Why do you think it makes sense (or not) to have max be final?
 *     It makes sense to have max be final because the number of sides
 *     for a die should not change after it is created.
 *     4. What does maxâ€™s being final say about 
 *     the abstraction of a MultiDie object?
 *     Max's being final says that the abstraction of a MuliDie object
 *     is that it represents a physical die that has a fixed number of sides.
 *     5. Is max an instance variable?
 *     Yes, max is an instance variable.
